The limerick is furtive and mean

You must keep her in close quarantine

Or she sneaks to the slums

And promptly becomes

Disorderly, drunk and obscene.

She'd been exorcised, thus finding rest,

But alack and alas

Her old demon came back

and now the poor girl's repossessed.

Who suffered severely from pisles

Without a deep frown

So he had to row standing for misles

Whose sculptures by most were thought hideous

He carved Aphrodite

Without even a nightie

Which shocked all the fussy fastidious

A new value of pi to assign.

I would fix it at 3,

For it's simpler, you see,

Than 3 point 1 4 1 5 9

who had triplets, Nat, Pat and Tat;

It was fun in the breeding,

But hell in the feeding,

When she found she had no tit for Tat.

With a big Carving Knife

until the fourth line

Really liked playing with fire.

One night in the dark

He swam with a shark,

And his voice is now two octaves higher.

By winds that left her quite nude,

Saw a man come along,

And unless we are wrong,

You expected this line to be lewd.

Who painted her ass like a Dahlia

The shape it was fine

And the color devine

But the aroma--well, that was a faihlia

In a relative way

 And returned on the previous night. 



I once took our vicar to tea;

It was just as I thought it would be:

     His rumblings abdominal

     Were simply phenomenal,

And everyone thought it was me.

I wonder why didn't it fall

Because its feet stuck

Or was it just luck

Or does gravity miss things so small?

A new hydrocarbon,

And made cider inside his inside.



Said an ape as he swung by his tail,

To his offspring both female and male,

  "From your offspring, my dears,

  In a couple of years,

May evolve a professor at Yale."

 

God's plan made a hopeful beginning,

But Man spoilt his chances by sinning;

  We trust that the story

  Will end in great glory,

But at present the other side's winning.

And no one can understand Ein.

In the bath that she took

Turned out to be Plaster of Paris.

Whose knowledge grew lesser and lesser,

It at last grew so small

And now he's a college professor.

 

The limerick's callous and crude,

Its morals distressingly lewd;

It's not worth the reading

By persons of breeding -

It's designed for us vulgar and rude.



 

The limerick packs laughs anatomical

Into space that is quite economical.

But the good ones I've seen

So seldom are clean -

And the clean ones so seldom are comical.

For the books that were clean,

just kept getting fewer and fewer.

Lived a chicken a duck and a goat.
They wanted to go out 
And wander about
But all they needed was a boat.
